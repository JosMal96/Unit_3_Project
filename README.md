# Unit 3 Project
#### By: Ishwarya Sundhararajan, Josean Maldonado

This project aims to analyze data breaches both in the United States and worldwide to identify patterns and trends, particularly focusing on the sectors most affected and the predominant attack methods. By examining a comprehensive dataset of cyber incidents, the project seeks to provide insights into the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats and their implications for organizations and individuals.

## Objectives
- Analyze data breaches to determine which sectors are most frequently targeted.
- Identify the predominant attack methods employed in cyber incidents.
- Provide insights and recommendations for enhancing cybersecurity measures.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes datasets sourced from reputable sources(i.e. Kaggle), encompassing a wide range of cyber incidents reported both in the US and globally. These datasets have been curated to ensure accuracy and reliability in the analysis process.
- Dataset #1: [Data Breaches](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/data-breaches-a-comprehensive-list)
- Dataset #2:  [World Data Breaches](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-and-hacks)

## Analysis Approach
The analysis involves:
- Identifying demographic trends in affected sectors.
- Investigating which is the predominent attack method used.
- Examining the number of cyber incidents and records being lost per year.
- Assessing any correlations between the sector of organization and frequency of cyber attacks.

## Features/Functionalities
1. **Data Exploration and Hypothesis Formulation:**
   - Utilizes exploratory data analysis techniques to understand the structure and content of the combined dataset.
   - Formulates hypotheses about factors influencing cyber attacks and data breaches, including organization sector, attack method, and records lost. 

2. **Data Cleaning Techniques:**
   - Implements Python programming and the pandas library to perform at least five data cleaning techniques on each dataset separately.
   - Techniques include handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies in the dataset.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Performs basic exploratory data analysis to validate initial hypotheses and extract meaningful insights.
   - Utilizes descriptive statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns in the data.

4. **Business Case Implementation:**
   - Applies findings from the data analysis to address a defined business case, such as developing customized cybersecurity solutions tailored to the specific attack patterns identified within targeted industries or sectors.
   - Provides recommendations based on insights derived from the data to support business decision-making processes.

5. **Documentation and Code Structure:**
   - Ensures clear documentation of code functionality, including comments and docstrings for clarity and reproducibility.
   - Organizes code into modular functions or classes to facilitate code reuse and maintainability.
